# PixProx (Pictures Processor)

## About the Project

This project allows you to perform a sequence of operations on a bunch of photos using a configuration file.

This is a side-project; the code's a bit messy and I add features to this project as per my needs. 

##Â Setup and Usage

1. Install Python3
2. Clone the Repository
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `python3 pixprox.py -f input.yaml`

A sample yaml can be found in `input.yaml`
